Right now there's just this one.

## POSIX tsearch(3) example.

Following [POSIX tsearch(3) manual](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/tdelete.html) and [GNU C Library manual for tsearch()](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Tree-Search-Function.html) as much as possible.

Comments welcome.
